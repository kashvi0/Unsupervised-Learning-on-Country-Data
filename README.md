# Unsupervised-Learning-on-Country-Data
Built a clustering algorithm to categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. HELP International has been able to raise around $10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. So, the CEO has to make a decision about which countries are in the greatest need of aid. The goal of the project was to apply the principles of machine learning to an existing dataset to effectively suggest the countries on which the CEO needs to focus the most.<br />
